# Distributed image processor
The project consists in building a distributed algorithm to process and modify digital images with the purpose of applying different filters, such as: smooth, blur, sharpen, emboss. With the help of the MPI library, the communication between the participating processes is made, ensuring the partitioning of the processing blocks and solving the dependencies present at the boundaries.
Personal gains:
-	getting used with process distribution in order to reduce execution times
-	getting familiar with the MPI library in C language
-	visualization on practical tests of the impact during execution of distributed code

Programming language/libraries/tools used: C, MPI, distributed programming
